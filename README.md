# DM Haven

DM Haven is a simple web app for Dungeon Masters of all sorts (but built primarily for me so some choices were made).

By the time this app becomes usable it should contain
* item cards with two states — short (i.e. shown in search results), and long (this includes full description, damage, class requirements, etc.)
* omnibar for searching different categories of possible things in D&D world — classes, backgrounds, items, spells, you-name-it.
* filter for categories. a dropdown menu near the input (inside the search bar). It should selected on the category by default, so that the user could not have made a search outside a category. 
* dice rolls
* ability to drag-and-drop any card to any position on the webpage and pin it there. This way, DM can search and filter info and be sure to keep the most important information on the page.
