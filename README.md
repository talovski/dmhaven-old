# DM Haven

DM Haven is a simple web app for Dungeon Masters of all sorts (but built primarily for me so some choices were made).

By the time this app becomes usable it should contain
* item cards with two states — short (i.e. shown in search results), and long (this includes full description, damage, class requirements, etc.)
* omnibar for search different categories of possible things in D&D world — classes, backgrounds, items, spells, you-name-it
Omnibar should have a dropdown filter menu right of the input. Some category should be selected by default to make sure the user does not search index (because bad things will happen)
* dice rolls
* ability to drag-and-drop any card to any position on the webpage and pin it there. This way, DM can search and filter info and be sure to keep the most important information on the page.
